# Version 0.6.0 (2024-02-11)

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Breaking changeðŸš¨ðŸš¨:
- File generation is now behind the `generate` subcommand.
- Please use `heave generate <spec> <output>`

New features:
- `template` subcommand
  - `heave template` now prints the default template
- `generate` subcommand
  - takes `--template` option for custom template

Chores:
- Add Getting Started section to README

# Version 0.5.0 (2024-02-10)

New features:
- Asserts are generated for schemas inside arrays now. Previously the only assert that was created was whether or not it was a collection. Now the schema is analyzed and asserts are generated for the first item in that array.
- Optional response fields are now generated with commented out asserts. This felt like a reasonable compromise since the spec doesn't guarantee that those fields will be present. The behavior works like this:
  - If the name of the field is in the objects required attribute, it will generate with a non-commented out assert
  - If the name of the field is not in the objects required attribute, it will not generate with a non-commented out assert
  - If an object is optional, all of it's children asserts will be commented out
  - If generating asserts for the items in an array, all of those will be commented out because the list _could be_ empty

# Version 0.4.0 (2024-02-09)

Bug Fixes:
- Better JSON pretty printing for request bodies.

Chores:
- Added cargo-insta for snapshot testing. This should make it easy to accumulate some specs and verify the outputs come out as expected
- Added GitHub action for CI to automate test running.

# Version 0.3.0 (2024-02-09)

New features:
- Slight improvement of documentation. This will be helpful when I actually write a decent README.
- Fixed panic
  - The request_body generation assumed that Strings, Numbers, Integers, and Booleans would always have a name associated with them. This isn't the case when you have an Array of these types though.

# Version 0.2.0 (2024-02-8)

New features:
- Added support for request bodies. The schema should be recursively generated in the hurl file with empty strings or 0.

# Version 0.1.0 (2024-02-8)

Initial Release! Here are some things that seem to work:
- Successfully parses OpenAPI parameters for every operation
- Path Parameters are included in hurl files as variables
- Query Parameters are available under the [QueryStringParams] section
- Header Params are also included
- Asserts are included based off schema definition for each response
